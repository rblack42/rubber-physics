# CFD and HPC Lecture

This lecture was put together for an introductory class in *Computstional Fluid
Dynamics at the *University of Kansas* in August, 2023. This lecture is a brief
look at the history of CFD and High Performance Computing, not a deep look at
CFD itself. 

The basic lecture was created using *Jupyterlab*. Example code is written in
*Python*, and can be run in the *Jupyterlab* environment. Standalone code is
also included for a test program that solves the axisymmetric hypersonic flow
over a missile shaped vehicle. The code is based on a study I conducted in
1975, while working as a research scientist at the *Aerospace Research
Laboratory* at *Wright-Patterson Air Force Base* in Dayton, Ohio.

In addition to the basic lecture presented, this project will also include
material detailing experiments I am conducting to move my example code into a
clustered computer environment. These experiments will be done using Python and
modern versions of *Fortran*. My hope is that they will serve as an introduction
to writing code for current high-performance machines.
