1. How did you get here?
	- Grow up in the Smithsonian (Wright Flyer 1944 *)
	- First airplane a ride 1951 (Connie *)
2. Human Flight
    - Build something and jump off a cliff
        - DaVinci Ornithopter (*)
    - Models are safer
        - Indoor models (*)
        - Serious wind tunnel models (*)
        - Another way? The Numerical Wind Tunnel
3. The Math of Flight
    - Gottfried Leibniz calculus (1684)
    - Isaac Newton laws of motion (1687)

        - finite differences
    - Rankine laws of thermodynamics (1850)
    - Claude-Louis Navier (1822) and George Stokes (1850)
    - Add in gas laws
    - Then find a way to solve them
        - lop off terms to make them easier
        - Potential flow - we could figure out airfoils!
    - We need a better way!

            - Jacquard Loom punched cards (1804)
        - Curta Calculator (1938 in Buchenwald Prison Camp *,+)
            - replaced my slide rule (+)
    - World War II
        - Harvard Mark 1 (1944) (+ book)
